# PRODIGY_WD_1
As part of the Prodigy InfoTech Web Development Internship, I developed a fully responsive and interactive e-commerce landing page that simulates a modern online shopping platform. The design includes a fixed navigation bar that changes style on scroll, a full-width hero banner with a compelling call-to-action, and multiple content-rich sections featuring categories like clothing, electronics, and accessories. The page is designed to span five to six scrolls, offering a dynamic browsing experience with visually appealing images, product cards, and highlighted deals. Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the layout is optimized for both desktop and mobile devices, ensuring accessibility across all screen sizes. The use of CSS animations, hover effects, and smooth transitions enhances user engagement, while the responsive navigation menu adapts perfectly to smaller screens. The landing page also includes a professional footer with contact details, completing the look and feel of a real, high-end online storefront.
